Assignment Three for Game 625, by Kristen Marcinek, Watkin Jones, and Alethea Saliba

The problem we set out to solve was implementing a forest that only loads in when the player is looking at it, in order to save memory and processing power.
We were able to address this issue using the object pool pattern. While our implementation still needs some refinement, we currently have objects loading in when the player faces a direction, and despawning when they look away.
